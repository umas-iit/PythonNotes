        "Though Python 3.0 was first released in 2008, adoption has been relatively slow, particularly in the scientific and web development communities.\n",
        "This is primarily because it took some time for many of the essential third-party packages and toolkits to be made compatible with the new language internals.\n",
        "Since early 2014, however, stable releases of the most important tools in the data science ecosystem have been fully compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and so this book will use the newer Python 3 syntax.\n",

        "\n",
        "- [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) gives you the Python interpreter itself, along with a command-line tool called ``conda`` which operates as a cross-platform package manager geared toward Python packages, similar in spirit to the apt or yum tools that Linux users might be familiar with.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) includes both Python and conda, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing. Because of the size of this bundle, expect the installation to consume several gigabytes of disk space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any of the packages included with Anaconda can also be installed manually on top of Miniconda; for this reason I suggest starting with Miniconda.\n",
        "\n",
